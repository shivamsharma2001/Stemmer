§ ---OOV

Indentation ---Dictionary Word 

Python ---Dictionary Word 

uses ---Dictionary Word 

whitespace ---OOV

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

rather ---Dictionary Word 

than ---Dictionary Word 

curly ---Dictionary Word 

brackets ---Dictionary Word 

or ---Dictionary Word 

keywords ---Dictionary Word 

to ---Dictionary Word 

delimit ---Dictionary Word 

blocks. ---OOV

An ---Dictionary Word 

increase ---Dictionary Word 

in ---Dictionary Word 

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

comes ---Dictionary Word 

after ---Dictionary Word 

certain ---Dictionary Word 

statements; ---OOV

a ---Dictionary Word 

decrease ---Dictionary Word 

in ---Dictionary Word 

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

signifies ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

end ---Dictionary Word 

of ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

current ---Dictionary Word 

block.[62] ---OOV

Thus ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

program's ---Dictionary Word 

visual ---Dictionary Word 

structure ---Dictionary Word 

accurately ---Dictionary Word 

represents ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

program's ---Dictionary Word 

semantic ---Dictionary Word 

structure.[1] ---OOV

This ---Dictionary Word 

feature ---Dictionary Word 

is ---Dictionary Word 

sometimes ---Dictionary Word 

termed ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

off-side ---OOV

rule ---Dictionary Word 

which ---Dictionary Word 

some ---Dictionary Word 

other ---Dictionary Word 

languages ---Dictionary Word 

share ---Dictionary Word 

but ---Dictionary Word 

in ---Dictionary Word 

most ---Dictionary Word 

languages ---Dictionary Word 

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

doesn't ---Dictionary Word 

have ---Dictionary Word 

any ---Dictionary Word 

semantic ---Dictionary Word 

meaning. ---OOV

Statements ---Dictionary Word

Python's ---Dictionary Word

use ---Dictionary Word

Unlike ---Dictionary Word 

many ---Dictionary Word

it ---Dictionary Word 

does ---Dictionary Word 

not ---Dictionary Word 

use ---Dictionary Word

Indentation ---Dictionary Word

An ---Dictionary Word 

increase ---Dictionary Word

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

comes ---Dictionary Word 

after ---Dictionary Word 

certain ---Dictionary Word 

statements; ---OOV

a ---Dictionary Word

the ---Dictionary Word

Thus ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word

accurately ---Dictionary Word 

represents ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

program's ---Dictionary Word 

semantic ---Dictionary Word 

structure.[1] ---OOV

This ---Dictionary Word 

feature ---Dictionary Word 

is ---Dictionary Word 

sometimes ---Dictionary Word 

termed ---Dictionary Word 

the ---Dictionary Word 

off-side ---OOV

rule ---Dictionary Word 

which ---Dictionary Word 

some ---Dictionary Word 

other ---Dictionary Word 

languages ---Dictionary Word 

share ---Dictionary Word 

but ---Dictionary Word 

in ---Dictionary Word 

most ---Dictionary Word

indentation ---Dictionary Word

an ---Dictionary Word

Its ---Dictionary Word

Unlike ---Dictionary Word 

many ---Dictionary Word

it ---Dictionary Word

An ---Dictionary Word

Python ---Dictionary Word

meant ---Dictionary Word 

to ---Dictionary Word 

be ---Dictionary Word 

an ---Dictionary Word

readable ---Dictionary Word 

language. ---OOV

Its ---Dictionary Word 

formatting ---Dictionary Word 

is ---Dictionary Word 

visually ---Dictionary Word 

uncluttered ---Dictionary Word 

and ---Dictionary Word 

it ---Dictionary Word 

often ---Dictionary Word 

uses ---Dictionary Word 

English ---Dictionary Word 

keywords ---Dictionary Word 

where ---Dictionary Word 

other ---Dictionary Word 

languages ---Dictionary Word 

use ---Dictionary Word 

punctuation. ---OOV

Unlike ---Dictionary Word 

many ---Dictionary Word 

other ---Dictionary Word 

languages ---Dictionary Word 

it ---Dictionary Word 

does ---Dictionary Word 

not ---Dictionary Word 

use ---Dictionary Word 

curly ---Dictionary Word

delimit ---Dictionary Word

and ---Dictionary Word 

semicolons ---Dictionary Word 

after ---Dictionary Word

has ---Dictionary Word 

fewer ---Dictionary Word

Indentation ---Dictionary Word 

Python ---Dictionary Word 

uses ---Dictionary Word 

whitespace ---OOV

rather ---Dictionary Word 

than ---Dictionary Word 

curly ---Dictionary Word

An ---Dictionary Word 

increase ---Dictionary Word

indentation ---Dictionary Word 

comes ---Dictionary Word 

after ---Dictionary Word 

certain ---Dictionary Word 

statements; ---OOV

a ---Dictionary Word

the ---Dictionary Word

the ---Dictionary Word

sometimes ---Dictionary Word

the ---Dictionary Word

which ---Dictionary Word 

some ---Dictionary Word

An ---Dictionary Word
